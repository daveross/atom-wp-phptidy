# atom-wp-phptidy package

Atom package of a modified version [wp-phptidy](https://github.com/scribu/wp-phptidy)

## Usage

On Mac:
```
cmd-shift-l
```

Windows and Linux isn't supported by default since I haven't test Atom on Windows or Linux. Feel free to contribute!

You can add it to your `keymap.cson` with the command `wp-phptidy:run`.
